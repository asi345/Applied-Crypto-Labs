Thanks for the challenges, they were mind boggling but fun to solve!
M5 took too much time of me, since it was not familiar with any other
challenge I saw before. But total time I spent for the lab was 
reasonable for me. Difficulty level is also okay. If it would be
harder, I would have to skip one or two because of my busy semester.
